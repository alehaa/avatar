# Avatar

This repository contains all sources of my current and past avatars as vector
graphics.

<img src="src/avatar-01.svg" width="50%" />


## Generate PNG

To generate rasterized versions, imagemagick's `convert` tool can be used. A
file with transparent background, 500px wide, can be generated by using this
command:

```
docker run               \
    --rm -it             \
    -v $PWD:$PWD -w $PWD \
    dpokidov/imagemagick \
    -background none     \
    -density 687         \
    src/avatar-01.svg    \
    avatar.png
```

If the target platform doesn't support transparent backgrounds, `#eee` should be
used for light environments and `#1e1e1e` for dark ones.


## Notes

Despite not being  perfectly symmetrical, all avatar SVGs are optimized to be
displayed in circle-shape, as this is today's standard of most websites. Like it
or not.
